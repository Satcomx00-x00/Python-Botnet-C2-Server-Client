"""
A block cipher is a method of encrypting text,
in which a cryptographic key and algorithm are applied to a block of data
(for example, 64 contiguous bits) at once as a group rather than to one bit at a time.

A block cipher is a deterministic algorithm operating on fixed-length groups of bits,
called a block, with an unvarying transformation that is specified by a symmetric key.
Block ciphers operate as important elementary components in the design of many cryptographic protocols,
and are widely used to implement encryption of bulk data.
